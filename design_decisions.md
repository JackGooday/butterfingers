# Design Decisions

To have M3 rods through the entire motor unit, they need to pass around the outside of the motor (minimum width of 42mm) and inside the bearing. A bearing with an internal diameter (ID) of 50mm is to small (leaves 4mm on each side, an M3 rod is 3mm). Need an ID of 55 or larger. The cheapest bearing you can get of this size is $25, which is too much of a difference from the $11 30ID one.
